001 - Basic Ross Sea case as obtained from Mike Dinniman June 2012.  Includes ice shelves, sea ice (Budgell), and 3 dye tracers (CDW, ice shelf melt water, sea ice melt water).  Runs off a 6 year spin up where model day 2190 = 9/15/2010.  Last model day is 2/28/2012.  This time period corresponds with the PRISM cruise.  5-day outputs. Files deleted 2/26/2013.

002 - Partly corrupted 12 hour (?) output run - kuroshio went down during data transfer and ross_his_0290.nc was corrupted and lost.  Files deleted b/c better ones in 003.

003 - Completed 12 hour output run with avg, his, and dia files all present.  First half of files deleted. 2013-07-08 All deleted (unused) 2015-01-22.

004 - First try running the base Ross Sea case on ROMS v3.6.  Sea ice variables were not recorded in output file because there are issues with the sea ice code obtained from Kate.  Also, dye02 (sea ice melt) is zero everywhere all the time.  Something is not right.  Files deleted. 1/23/2013

005 - 1 month run (30 days) as a test after fixing some of the sea ice files and fixing the output problem.  Files deleted. 1/23/2013

019 - v3.6, rerun of 017 with i2d_bc.F updated on ALL boundaries this time.  Had to restart model run a little over a year in due to an instability (model blew up) in velocity in layers 2 & 3 at i=7, j=293.
